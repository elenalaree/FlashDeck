# Overview


Flash Deck is a user driven flash card app that allows users to input as many cards as they want into separate decks so they can study information in chunks. It takes user input, saves it to local storage, and then displays buttons linking the user to those datasets as flashcards. 

I made this app because my daughter needs to learn her math facts. I thought it would inspire her to do them because I made the app she was using.

# Development Environment

I used VSCode and Expo Go on my phone to make this Mobile app

I made FlashDeck with React Native. Expo augmented this and allowed me to port the app to my phone. I used Javascript for the functionality. It uses react native async storage and react navigation packages. It uses the dev Dependency of babel.
